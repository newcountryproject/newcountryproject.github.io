            <h2 id="intent">Declaration of Intent:</h2>

            There is no nation on Earth where one can carry his pistol, utilize his vehicle without authorization, collect his paycheque without loss, and do business strictly on his own terms.<br/>
            <br/>
            The Earth has been plagued with the notion that making decisions for someone else, without their concent, is acceptable. Furthermore, when man is allowed to enter into the affairs of politics, he is given one vote. Nothing in his ablity can grow that vote. He can run for office, but then another man only has one vote to give him. This is one aspect of democracy: regardless of your ability, your actions, you are only worth "one". If you are outnumbered, the rest can decide how you live, how you eat, how you sleep, how you do business, and how you protect yourself.<br/>
            <br/>
            But the reality is far worse than that. In the United States, the majority have a loose hand picking those whom will cast their votes for them. One way or another, the once possibly well-intended democracy turns into an endless argument with no satisfied parties, as everyone involved has made the first mistake: to force another to live as they say. The details vary, but the effect is the same.<br/>
            <br/>
            I am convinced that the only person who you can rightfully control is yourself.<br/>
            <br/>
            Of all of the many things mankind has invented in this era, he finds himself facing his incredible invention of control. We have reversed the laws of nature and replaced it with the rule of law. The first had groundings in biology. The other, grounded in an empty promise that thinking in someone else's place is the right thing to do.<br/>
            <br/>
            Not all of us are content with this system. In fact, the irony of the system is that the system of unconsent largely exists because of our consent and lack of resistance. Even of the system's supporters, so few would actually live up to what it is, and what they have called for. How many will risk their lives to stop a person from doing as they decide to do? How many would actually pull the trigger on a person who they didn't know, who had never wronged them? How many would give the death penalty? How many would imprison someone, if they themselves were the jailkeeper?<br/>
            <br/>
            There is nothing remarkable about this. Many will ask, "But how will this important thing happen without it?". There is no easy answer. No text will tell you how to live your life faultlessly. No text will "solve society". Though a society without a supreme system of unconsent leaves many questions, does that mean it's not the answer?<br/>
            <br/>
            I write this, ultimately, as I. There are people skeptically interested in what I am doing. But, I won't speak on their behalf. I will speak on mine.<br/>
            <br/>
            I do not take this lightly. I understand this is an immense challenge of many facets. I would not do this if I did not see if there was another way, and if my complaints were minor. They are not minor.<br/>
            <br/>
            Presently, I am a citizen of the United States. Which, I am proud of. Any two glances at our founding documents will show more wisdom than I will ever muster. The intent of the Founding Fathers was remarkable. They sought freedom through consent.<br/>
            <br/>
            To take a brief snippet of a document not worth cutting short, "That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,".<br/>
            <br/>
            While I would love to bring back the United States to its former state, I don't believe it is far different than what its citizens have asked of it. It is not an elite group of rulers using militant force against the masses -- it is the masses asking for an elite group of rulers to use militant forces to protect them from themselves.<br/>
            <br/>
            In a hundredth the spirit of freedom and rightness which our Founding Fathers had, I wish to part ways with this nation and start my own. Being, hopefully, somewhat consistent with what I say, I wish to do it as voluntarily as possible. I do not want to steal land from its owner. I do not want to force people from their land, to take it, to then call it "a place of freedom". I do not expect to get the consent of the United States, nor of any of its States. But from the original owner, that is a good minimum, unless there is worthy land (or sea) out there which is viable.<br/>
            <br/>
            I see no point in separating myself, becoming "free", and then being alone. If you have exceptional courage, ability, and believe in doing what is right, I hope that you will join me and hopefully others in this endeavor. I am not looking for followers or blind interest, but individuals who come together and see this as the best step in which they can pursue their happiness.<br/>
            <br/>
            Whether this means online, in our own encampment, or in your own neck of the woods. Perhaps some day, there will not be zero free nations on Earth. There may not be only one.<br/>
            <br/>
            Perhaps in a far and distant future, it will no longer the "normal" to be told what to do and how to do it.<br/>
            <br/>
            Until then, at least your mind is yours. And your will can never be taken from you.<br/>
            <br/>
            To a voluntary world,<br/>
